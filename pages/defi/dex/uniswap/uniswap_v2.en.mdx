    First step is to sort token addresses. Remember the createPair function? We used sorted token addresses as salt.
    Next, we build a sequence of bytes that includes:
        0xff – this first byte helps to avoid collisions with CREATE opcode. (More details are in EIP-1014.)
        factoryAddress – factory that was used to deploy the pair.
        salt – token addressees sorted and hashed.
        hash of pair contract bytecode – we hash creationCode to get this value.
    Then, this sequence of bytes gets hashed (keccak256) and converted to address (bytes->uint256->uint160->address).

This whole process is defined in EIP-1014 and implemented in the CREATE2 opcode. What we’re doing here is reimplementing address generation in Solidity!
