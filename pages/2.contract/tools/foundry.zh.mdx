# Why foundry

While HardHat is still a popular solution, more and more projects are switching to Foundry. And there are multiple reasons for that:

    With Foundry, we can write tests in Solidity. This is much more convenient because we don’t need to jump between JavaScript (Truffle and HardHat use JS for tests and automation) and Solidity during development. Writing tests in Solidity is much more convenient because you have all the native features (e.g. you don’t need a special type for big numbers and you don’t need to convert between strings and BigNumber).
    Foundry doesn’t run a node during testing. This makes testing and iterating on features much faster! Truffle and HardHat start a node whenever you run tests; Foundry executes tests on an internal EVM.

Foundry is a set of tools for Ethereum applications development. Specifically, we’re going to use:

    Forge, a testing framework for Solidity.
    Anvil, a local Ethereum node designed for development with Forge. We’ll use it to deploy our contracts to a local node and connect to it through the front-end app.
    Cast, a CLI tool with a ton of helpful features.


Forge makes smart contracts developer’s life so much easier. With Forge, we don’t need to run a local node to test contracts. Instead, Forge runs tests on its internal EVM, which is much faster and doesn’t require sending transactions and mining blocks.

Forge lets us write tests in Solidity! Forge also makes it easier to simulate blockchain state: we can easily fake our ether or token balance, execute contracts from other addresses, deploy any contracts at any address, etc.

However, we’ll still need a local node to deploy our contract to. For that, we’ll use Anvil. Front-end applications use JavaScript Web3 libraries to interact with Ethereum nodes (to send transaction, query state, estimate transaction gas cost, etc.)–this is why we’ll need to run a local node.
