# Gas 优化

## 减少 SSTORE

打包

The reason is that each state variable corresponds to a certain storage slot, and EVM uses 32-byte storage slots (every storage slot is exactly 32 bytes). When you read a state variable value, it’s get read from the storage slot this variable is linked to. Every SLOAD call reads 32 bytes at a time, and every SSTORE call writes 32 bytes at a time. Since these are expensive operations, we’d really want to reduce the number of storage reads and writes. And this is where proper laying out of state variables might help.

```solidity"

uint112 private reserve0;
uint112 private reserve1;
uint32 private blockTimestampLast;

```

## 减少 SLOAD

案例

Uniswap UniswapV2Pair

```solidity"

    // this low-level function should be called from a contract which performs important safety checks
    function burn(address to) external lock returns (uint amount0, uint amount1) {
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1,) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        address _token0 = token0;                                // gas savings
        address _token1 = token1;                                // gas savings
        uint balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint balance1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint liquidity = balanceOf[address(this)];

        bool feeOn = _mintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1);
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply; // gas savings, must be defined here since totalSupply can update in _mintFee
        amount0 = liquidity.mul(balance0) / _totalSupply; // using balances ensures pro-rata distribution
        amount1 = liquidity.mul(balance1) / _totalSupply; // using balances ensures pro-rata distribution
        require(amount0 > 0 && amount1 > 0, 'UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY_BURNED');
        _burn(address(this), liquidity);
        _safeTransfer(_token0, to, amount0);
        _safeTransfer(_token1, to, amount1);
        balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        balance1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this));

        _update(balance0, balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
        if (feeOn) kLast = uint(reserve0).mul(reserve1); // reserve0 and reserve1 are up-to-date
        emit Burn(msg.sender, amount0, amount1, to);
    }
```

## 内存布局
It might be beneficial to use reduced-size types if you are dealing with storage values because the compiler will pack multiple elements into one storage slot, and thus, combine multiple reads or writes into a single operation. If you are not reading or writing all the values in a slot at the same time, this can have the opposite effect, though: When one value is written to a multi-value storage slot, the storage slot has to be read first and then combined with the new value such that other data in the same slot is not destroyed.

When dealing with function arguments or memory values, there is no inherent benefit because the compiler does not pack these values.

However, for short values (shorter than 32 bytes) the array elements are stored together with the length in the same slot.




## Assembly

The low-level calls which operate on addresses rather than contract instances (i.e. .call(), .delegatecall(), .staticcall(), .send() and .transfer()) do not include this check, which makes them cheaper in terms of gas but also less safe.
